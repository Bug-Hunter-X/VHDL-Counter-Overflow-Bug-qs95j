# VHDL Counter with Overflow Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in VHDL code related to counter overflow.  The `buggy_counter.vhd` file contains a counter that might not behave as expected due to potential issues with clock stability or reset signal glitches. The `fixed_counter.vhd` shows how the issue can be addressed.
